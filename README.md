# My-project
Motorcycle shop built with react, node.js and mongoDB.

Hello, this is my first big project that i have built by myself. You can see that sometimes i used bootstrap and sometimes i made my own Modals, same with validation, sometimes i used formik and sometimes i made my own validation, this is just to practice as many things as possible, i am aware thats not probably how things goes in "reall life" projects. What i am definitly happy about is the logic i came up with, about uploading many pictures at once with cloudinary, also making the "reset-password" token a single-use token, and many other things i came up with. I am also satisfied about most components structure, althought some of them are totall mess. What i am definitly not proud of is the css code, there is much to improve, but the general appearance of the site is really good i think. I've learned a lot, and came up with many solutions, but i still have many questions, and problems i cannot solve by myself, i want to get better.

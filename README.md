# My-project
Motorcycle shop built with react, node.js and mongoDB.

Hello, the purpouse of this project was to learn and practise as much as posibble, but also to create something beautiful, i know that "reall life" projects are made a bit diffrent. What i am definitly happy about is the logic i came up with, about uploading many pictures all at once with cloudinary, also making the "reset-password" token a single-use token, and many other things i came up with. I am also satisfied about most components structure, their look and responsivness, althought some of them are totall mess. There is still so much to improve, but the general appearance of the site is really good i think. I've learned a lot, and came up with many solutions, but i still have many questions, and problems i cannot solve by myself, i want to get better.

There is really a lot of going on in this project. U can create an account which will not be verified, u will recieve an email, to verify your account. U can change ur email, password, name and lastname, u can resset ur password if u forget it, u can sign up to newsletter. In the shop u can sort and filter the products, u can add them to the cart, then create an order but only if u are verified. As an administrator, u can add and delete products, brands, categories, everything lands in mongoDB, expect images, those will be stored in cloudinary. The page is fully responsive, but be carefull with dynamically changing the resolution cuz its not something the user would do, and some things, in order to change, need the browser to refresh the page.
